Bossfight â€” Subject image packs

Place boss images in folders using the naming convention:

assets/bosses/{subject}-boss/
  - base-position.png      (base pose)
  - attack-position.png    (boss attacking)
  - hit-position.png       (boss being hit)
  - defeated-position.png  (boss defeated)

Examples already included: `math-boss`, `phonics-boss`, `story-comprehension-boss`.

In the app open Config (G) and choose the subject from the Image Pack dropdown. The app will load images from the matching folder and fall back to a placeholder if any image is missing.
